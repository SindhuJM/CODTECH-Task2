Objective

The program aims to provide a system for managing library items like books, magazines, and DVDs. It facilitates adding new items to the library's collection.

Key Activities

   1.Adding Library Items:Users can add new library items (books, magazines, DVDs) to the system by providing information such as title, author, category, and item type.

   2.Checking Out Items:Users can check out available items from the library. The checkout process updates the item's status, assigns a due date (14 days from the checkout date), and 
     sets the item as "checked out."
     
   3.Returning Items:When users return items, the program checks whether the item is overdue. If it is, a fine is calculated (assuming $1 per day of overdue). The item's status is 
     updated to "available" after it is returned.
     
   4.Searching Items:Users can search for items based on a search term, which can be a title, author, or category. The program will display all matching items and their current status 
     (checked out or available).
     
   5.Displaying Items:The system displays items in the library, showing details such as title, author, category, and their availability status (checked out or available).

 Technologies Used

    1.Python Programming Language:The program is written in Python, leveraging its simplicity and versatility to manage the library system and implement object-oriented concepts 
      effectively.
      
    2.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):The program uses object-oriented principles by creating classes (e.g., LibraryItem and Library) to represent entities in the system. This approach 
      encapsulates related data and behavior, promoting modularity and code reuse.

    3.Datetime Module:The datetime module is used for handling date operations. The program calculates the due date for items when they are checked out and compares the current date with 
      the due date to check for overdue items.

    4.Lists:Python's list data structure is used to store library items. The list helps in managing the collection of items and performing operations like adding, searching, and 
      displaying items.

    5.Input and Output Handling:The program uses Python's built-in input() function to interact with the user, allowing them to enter data for adding items, searching items, and 
      performing actions like checking out and returning items.The program also uses print() for outputting the status of items, messages related to actions taken, and results from 
      searches.

    6.Conditional Statements and Loops:Conditional statements (if, elif, else) are used throughout the program to determine the actions that should be taken based on user input (e.g., 
      checking if an item is already checked out).A while True loop is used in the main function to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.

    7.Exception Handling (Implicit):While the program does not have explicit exception handling (e.g., try and except blocks), it is implicitly error-proofed by validating actions such 
      as checking out an already checked-out item or returning an item that wasn't checked out.
